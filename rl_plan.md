 Reinforcement Learning Pipeline for Hyperparameter 
  Optimization

  Here's how you could design an RL system to
  automatically optimize the config file to maximize R²
   score:

  1. RL Environment Design

  State Space:
  - Current configuration parameters (learning rate,
  batch size, layer sizes, dropout rates, etc.)
  - Recent training history (last 5-10 R² scores, loss
  curves)
  - Dataset characteristics (number of features,
  samples, etc.)
  - Current epoch/training progress

  Action Space:
  - Discrete actions for categorical choices:
    - Optimizer type (Adam, SGD, RMSprop)
    - Activation functions (ReLU, LeakyReLU, Swish)
    - Enable/disable callbacks
  - Continuous actions for numerical parameters:
    - Learning rate (0.0001 - 0.01)
    - Batch size (8, 16, 32, 64)
    - Layer units (32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024)
    - Dropout rates (0.0 - 0.5)
    - Number of layers (3-10)

  Reward Function:
  - Primary reward: R² score improvement
  - Penalty terms: Training time, model complexity
  - Shaped rewards: Validation loss improvement,
  convergence speed
  - Multi-objective: reward = α*R² - β*training_time - 
  γ*model_params

  2. RL Algorithm Choices

  Option A: Policy Gradient (PPO/A3C)
  - Good for mixed discrete/continuous action spaces
  - Can handle multi-objective optimization
  - Stable training with policy clipping

  Option B: Deep Q-Network (DQN) with Discretization
  - Discretize continuous parameters into bins
  - Use Rainbow DQN for improved sample efficiency
  - Easier to implement and debug

  Option C: Actor-Critic with Continuous Control 
  (DDPG/TD3/SAC)
  - Best for continuous hyperparameters
  - Can model complex parameter interactions
  - Requires more tuning

  3. Training Pipeline Architecture

  Meta-Learning Loop:
  1. RL Agent proposes new config
  2. Config Generator creates YAML file
  3. DNN Trainer trains model with new config
  4. Evaluator measures R², training time, complexity
  5. Reward Calculator computes shaped reward
  6. RL Agent updates policy based on reward

  Parallel Training:
  - Run multiple DNN training jobs simultaneously
  - Use experience replay buffer for RL agent
  - Implement asynchronous updates

  4. State Representation

  Config Encoding:
  state = [
      learning_rate,           # Current LR
      batch_size_normalized,   # Batch size /
  max_batch_size
      layer_count,            # Number of layers
      avg_layer_size,         # Average units per layer
      total_dropout,          # Sum of all dropout
  rates
      optimizer_one_hot,      # [1,0,0] for Adam,
  [0,1,0] for SGD
      last_5_r2_scores,       # Historical performance
      training_epochs_so_far, # Progress indicator
      feature_count,          # Dataset characteristics
      sample_count_log        # log(number of samples)
  ]

  5. Action Space Design

  Hierarchical Actions:
  1. High-level decisions: Architecture changes
  (add/remove layers)
  2. Mid-level decisions: Layer size adjustments
  3. Low-level decisions: Learning rate, batch size
  fine-tuning

  Action Masking:
  - Prevent invalid combinations (e.g., batch_size >
  dataset_size)
  - Ensure minimum/maximum constraints
  - Block actions that would cause memory issues

  6. Reward Shaping Strategies

  Progressive Rewards:
  - Early stopping bonus if converges quickly
  - Efficiency bonus for high R² with fewer parameters
  - Stability bonus for consistent validation
  performance

  Multi-Stage Rewards:
  - Stage 1: Quick convergence (first 50 epochs)
  - Stage 2: Peak performance (best R² achieved)
  - Stage 3: Stability (variance in last 20% of
  training)

  7. Sample Efficiency Improvements

  Transfer Learning:
  - Pre-train RL agent on simpler datasets
  - Use meta-learning to quickly adapt to new datasets
  - Share knowledge across similar regression tasks

  Smart Initialization:
  - Start with reasonable defaults from hyperparameter
  search literature
  - Use Bayesian optimization results as initial
  experience
  - Implement curriculum learning (simple → complex
  configs)

  Early Stopping for RL:
  - Terminate bad configurations early
  - Use learning curve prediction
  - Implement confidence intervals for performance
  estimation

  8. Implementation Considerations

  Computational Efficiency:
  - Use surrogate models for quick performance
  estimation
  - Implement progressive training (start with fewer
  epochs)
  - Cache results for repeated configurations

  Exploration Strategies:
  - ε-greedy with adaptive ε based on performance
  plateau
  - Thompson sampling for uncertainty-aware exploration
  - Curiosity-driven exploration for novel config
  regions

  Safety Constraints:
  - Maximum training time limits
  - Memory usage constraints
  - Minimum performance thresholds

  9. Advanced Features

  Population-Based Training Integration:
  - Run multiple RL agents with different strategies
  - Share experiences across population
  - Implement evolutionary pressure on RL policies

  Multi-Objective Optimization:
  - Pareto frontier for R² vs. complexity trade-offs
  - User-defined preference weights
  - Dynamic objective reweighting

  Continual Learning:
  - Adapt to changing datasets
  - Remember good configurations for similar problems
  - Meta-learning across multiple optimization runs

  10. Evaluation and Monitoring

  Performance Metrics:
  - Sample efficiency (configs needed to reach target
  R²)
  - Final best R² achieved
  - Training time reduction compared to grid/random
  search
  - Configuration diversity explored

  Ablation Studies:
  - Compare different reward functions
  - Test various state representations
  - Evaluate different RL algorithms

  This RL pipeline would essentially create an "AutoML
  agent" that learns to be a hyperparameter
  optimization expert specifically for your AQI
  prediction problem, potentially discovering novel
  configuration combinations that human experts might
  miss.
